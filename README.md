# Docker-Containers-using-AWS-Elastic-Container-Service
Implementation of Docker applications on Amazon ECS cluster(set of container instance) behind a
load balancer. By running an application as a service, Amazon ECS will auto recover any stopped
tasks and maintain the number of copies you specified.
You can use any image you want to be containerized. 
Amazon ECS places containers across your cluster based on your resource needs and is integrated with familiar features like Elastic Load Balancing, EC2 security groups, EBS volumes and IAM roles.
